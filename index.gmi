# BiRabittoh's Capsule
Welcome to my personal capsule!
I'll write about whatever comes to mind, mainly technology and art, so that people can read it when I get famous in 80 years or so.
=> gemlog Don't forget to check out my gemlog.
Also, big thanks to Leonie (koyu) for helping me host this!

## About me
Italian male born in 1998; I've been programming since 2016 and I love it.
I enjoy art in every form, including video-games, as well as every kind of humor. I usually hang around on Discord while programming stuff I'll probably never actually get finished.
While Italian is my main language, I can read and write perfect English. I'm a fast learner on any kind of programming language as long as it follows human logic.
The name BiRabittoh comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "B-Rabbit", as said in Pandora Hearts, which was the first anime I watched on the internet.
